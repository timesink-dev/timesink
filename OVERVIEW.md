# TimeSink Overview

This document introduces TimeSink: the idea, project, and its domain-specific terms.

## üö∞ What is TimeSink?

**TimeSink** is more than just a cinema; it‚Äôs a place where time is not lost, but held, preserved, and waiting. In the world of film, time has a cyclical nature‚Äîeach story is a sequence of moments, captured, frozen, and woven into a narrative that defies the usual flow of time. Like drops filling a well, these moments accumulate within each film, creating a timeless reservoir. The TimeSink.

When a film plays, it allows those moments to live again, inviting the audience to re-experience them as though for the first time. This is the magic of cinema: each viewing is a new encounter, bringing different meanings, emotions, and insights that only reveal themselves as they interact with the soul watching. A TimeSink exists to hold this magic, enabling audiences to step back into a film‚Äôs preserved moments, repeatedly discovering something new in the familiar.

The power of TimeSink lies in this continuity, in how each film remains alive as long as there is someone to witness it, a soul to animate the story. TimeSink captures this essence‚Äîa place where time flows and pauses, where films remain vibrant and re-watchable, and where each visit feels like a fresh discovery. It‚Äôs a reminder that time, in the hands of art, isn‚Äôt fleeting‚Äîit‚Äôs a wellspring, endlessly revisited, renewed, and re-experienced.
