In TimeSink, **Cinema** is more than just the act of watching films; it‚Äôs a carefully curated, shared experience that brings people together around stories, dreams, and artistry. Our platform aims to honor the tradition of cinema as a communal and cultural experience, beyond simply consuming "content." Each Showcase presents a unique selection of films, designed to capture the magic of theatergoing while fostering an active community of creators and viewers.

Cinema in TimeSink embraces the joy of discovery, sparking conversations and building connections as users engage in discussions, attend virtual premieres, and explore timeless works. This isn‚Äôt just about watching a film‚Äîit‚Äôs about connecting with the storytelling, the creator's vision, and the audience itself, making each viewing a memorable, shared experience.

### üéû Archives

The **Archives** represent the entire catalog and history of films that have been presented on TimeSink.

### üé¨ Showcases

A **Showcase** is a curated collection of films that go "live" simultaneously, available for viewing on the platform for a specific duration.

When a Showcase concludes, the films move to the Archives, preserving their legacy.

### üé• Ô∏è Film
