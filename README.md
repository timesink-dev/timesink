## üìñ Domain Terms

In TimeSink, we create a cinematic experience in a fictional theater. Below are key terms to ensure consistent understanding across our international team:

### üé• Cinema

> "Cinema is an old whore, like circus and variety, who knows how to give many kinds of pleasure."  
> ‚Äî **Federico Fellini**

On TimeSink, **Cinema** is more than just the act of watching films; it‚Äôs a carefully curated, shared experience that brings people together around stories, dreams, and artistry. Our platform aims to honor the tradition of cinema as a communal and cultural experience, beyond simply consuming "content." Each Showcase presents a unique selection of films, designed to capture the magic of theatergoing while fostering an active community of creators and viewers.

Cinema on TimeSink embraces the joy of discovery, sparking conversations and building connections as users engage in discussions, attend virtual premieres, and explore timeless works. This isn‚Äôt just about watching a film‚Äîit‚Äôs about connecting with the storytelling, the creator's vision, and the audience itself, making each viewing a memorable, shared experience.

### üéûÔ∏è Archive

The **Archives** represent the entire catalog and history of films that have been presented on TimeSink. This collection includes all films from previous showcases and acts as a repository where users can explore past selections and experience the full depth of TimeSink's cinematic offerings. The Archives serve as the "library" of the platform, where each film, once premiered, becomes part of this permanent collection.

### üé¨ Showcases

A **Showcase** is a curated collection of films that go "live" simultaneously, available for viewing on the platform for a specific duration. Think of a Showcase like a film festival lineup or a cinema "season," often with a shared theme or unique concept that brings the films together. Each Showcase transforms the platform into a set of "theaters" where users can access and watch these films during their designated run. When a Showcase concludes, the films move to the Archives, preserving their legacy.

### üìΩÔ∏è Film

Refers to a single movie or cinematic work available on TimeSink. Each **Film** is treated as a distinct piece within the platform, with details including its title, director, cast, genre, and synopsis. This term encompasses any standalone work of cinema that users can experience as part of a Showcase or later through the Archives.

### üçø Film Showing

An individual screening event or presentation of a **Film**, specifically as part of a Showcase. It is the "screening moment" for the Film within a given Showcase, similar to how a movie would be scheduled at a specific time in a cinema. Film Showings are time-bound, heightening the sense of exclusivity and excitement for audiences, and marking when the Film is available for real-time viewing on TimeSink.

### üé® Poster

A **Poster** is the primary visual representation of a Film, serving as its main promotional image on TimeSink. It functions as the "cover" that gives users a first impression of the Film, conveying its style, genre, and atmosphere. Posters are carefully selected to capture the essence of each Film and are displayed prominently in Showcases, on the homepage, and in the Archives.

### üé≠ Theater

A virtual cinema space where members enter to experience films together as part of a Showcase. Each Theater is dedicated to streaming a specific Film, providing a communal viewing environment that enhances the shared cinematic experience. Members can see who else is in the Theater, engage in live discussions, and interact with each other through chats and commentary features. The Theater is designed to foster community, encourage discussions about the film‚Äôs themes and artistry, and create a dynamic space where creators and audience members can connect and build relationships. This virtual setting brings the immersive atmosphere of a traditional cinema into an online format, complete with opportunities for real-time interaction, making each visit to the Theater a unique and engaging experience.

### ‚ô£Ô∏è Member

A **Member** of TimeSink is any registered user who actively participates in the platform. Members are not just viewers; they are part of a community that thrives on interaction, collaboration, and engagement. They can watch films, join discussions, share their thoughts, and connect with creators and fellow cinema enthusiasts. Members play a vital role in sustaining the culture of TimeSink by contributing to the ongoing conversation that surrounds each film and event.

As a member, you can:

- Engage in live discussions during screenings
- Interact with filmmakers and other viewers
- Leave comments on films, blogs, and articles
- Join in on community-driven events and initiatives

Being a member means being part of something bigger than just watching films ‚Äì it‚Äôs about shaping and contributing to the culture of cinema within TimeSink. Members are the lifeblood of the platform, ensuring that every screening, every showcase, and every film has the opportunity to spark meaningful conversations and new connections.
